When I started this blog in 2013 I used WordPress to avoid <a href="https://www.seanhelvey.com/reinventing-the-wheel/">reinventing the wheel</a> before moving over to Jekyll in 2016. I never took the time to set up continuous deployment so would SSH into DreamHost (strong CamelCase theme emerging here) then pull the generated static site from a Git submodule. The added friction was just enough so that I wouldn't post very often.

Now I feel super inspired by people like <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/">Cory Zue</a> and <a href="https://www.roycehaynes.com/">Royce Haynes</a> to be creative and express myself online more frequently. It is going to take some time though and I don't know exactly what it will look like. A custom Django publishing platform like <a href="https://simonwillison.net/">Simon Willison</a>? Zines or a Hugo site like <a href="https://jvns.ca/">Julia Evans</a>? For now I have begun migrating old projects off DreamHost and am using GitHub Pages to host the Jekyll site, but this is just temporary to reduce friction and get the ball rolling.

I am really curious about different mediums beyond RSS but want to keep the overhead of publishing newsletters and editing video / audio sustainable. What are the best free and easy ways to create content and use AI for transcription? Another big question for me is how to segment different tags, topics, categories. I want to keep building tech community and still feel empowered to share personal life stuff. Should that all live here or be contained in different channels? 

Come along for the journey. Let's learn in public together!
